## Introduction

"Ganbatte" 

What does Ganbatte mean? Ganbatte (È†ëÂºµ„Å£„Å¶) is like a big virtual high-five from Japan! It's a way to say "good luck" or "do your best" to someone who's about to tackle a challenge.

Where does it come from? Ganbatte is derived from the verb ganbaru (È†ëÂºµ„Çã), which means to persevere or do one's best. It's like a motivational mantra to help you push through tough times!

Hey, I'm not fluent in Nihonggo but I love this word as it resonates in what I truly believe on how we can overcome any challenge in life by failing forward and taking those lessons as a guide post on how we can get up and stand back and try again.
